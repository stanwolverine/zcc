ZCC app meets all the following requirements:
- âœ… Supported Platforms: Android, iOS, Web
- âœ… Uses Typescript
- âœ… UI matches the provided design
- âœ… Includes Unit tests using jest & react-native-testing-library
- âœ… Includes E2E tests using Maestro
- âœ… Clean and readable source code
- âœ… Connects to AWS Amplify GraphQL endpoint to fetch data
- âœ… Displays list of users and option to filter them
- âœ… (Bonus) Pull to Refresh

## Get started

1. Clone the repo into your machine

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stanwolverine/zcc
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Quickly starting app using Expo Go
   > [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) is a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo
   
   - On Android
      ```bash
      npm run start:expo-go:android
      ```

   - On iOS Simulator
      ```bash
      npm run start:expo-go:ios
      ```

   - On Web
      ```bash
      npm run start:expo-go:web
      ```

   In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a
   - [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)

## Build on your machine

You can also build the app on your machine instead of using Expo Go. Refer [Local App Compilation](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/#local-app-compilation) and [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guides to setup environment on your machine.

If you face any problem while building, try building using following versions -

|  Tool   |    Version  |
| ------- | ----------- |
|  Node   |      18     |
|  Java   |      17     |
|  Ruby   |     3.1.0   |


> You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
